# Flask on Heroku

Welcome to my milestone project for the TDI 12-day course! This code grabs stock data from the alphavantage dataset and puts it into a pandas dataframe to be plotted via Bokeh embedding. Flask is used to tie the code to html and the app is deployed via Heroku. You can view my completed Heroku app [here](https://hevren-stock-analysis.herokuapp.com/). The app takes ticker, year, and various price metrics as inputs and outputs a time-series plot.

The repository contains a basic template for a Flask configuration that will
work on Heroku.


## Step 1: Setup and deploy
- Git clone the existing template repository.
- `Procfile`, `requirements.txt`, `conda-requirements.txt`, and `runtime.txt`
  contain some default settings.
- There is some boilerplate HTML in `templates/`
- Create Heroku application with `heroku create <app_name>` or leave blank to
  auto-generate a name.
- Deploy to Heroku: `git push heroku master`
- You should be able to see your site at `https://<app_name>.herokuapp.com`
- A useful reference is the Heroku [quickstart guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python).

## Step 2: Get data from API and put it in pandas
- Use the `requests` library to grab some data from a public API. This will
  often be in JSON format, in which case `simplejson` will be useful.
- Build in some interactivity by having the user submit a form which determines which data is requested.
- Create a `pandas` dataframe with the data.

## Step 3: Use Bokeh to plot pandas data
- Create a Bokeh plot from the dataframe.
- Consult the Bokeh [documentation](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html)
  and [examples](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/tree/master/examples/embed).
- Make the plot visible on your website through embedded HTML or other methods - this is where Flask comes in to manage the interactivity and display the desired content.
- Some good references for Flask: [This article](https://realpython.com/blog/python/python-web-applications-with-flask-part-i/), especially the links in "Starting off", and [this tutorial](https://github.com/bev-a-tron/MyFlaskTutorial).
